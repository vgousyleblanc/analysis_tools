'''## PID using the beam monitors
This code is the default way of identifying particles using the beam monitor. It is providing only a template event selection that is not optimised for any Physics analyses. It should serve as an exmple around which to build your own beam particle identification code. '''

#at least 0.5% of muons and pions are above the cut line. This is necessary in case the 
#Number of particles is too high to clearly see a minimum between the muons and pions
#A more thorough analysis might want to remove events that are close to the cut line for a higher purity
ana.tag_muons_pions_ACT35()

#This corrects any offset in the TOF (e.g. from cable length) that can cause the TOF 
#of electrons to be different from L/c This has to be calibrated to give meaningful momentum 
#estimates later on
